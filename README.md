# 🛡️ My Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Welcome to my public learning repository where I document everything I'm learning in the field of cybersecurity. From basic concepts to hands-on labs, this repo serves as my personal reference—and maybe even a helpful guide for others too.

## 📅 Timeline

- **Started on**: February 2025
- **Current Focus**: Network Fundamentals & Wireshark

---

## 📚 Topics Covered (so far)

- [x] Getting Started in Cybersecurity
- [x] Network Fundamentals (Professor Messer videos)
- [ ] Wireshark Deep Dive

## 🧪 Lab Setup

I’ve set up a personal virtual lab using:

- **VirtualBox / VMware** with Kali Linux and a Windows VM
- Simulated network traffic for analysis
- Wireshark for packet capturing and inspection

This gives me a safe environment to break things and learn hands-on.
